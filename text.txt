First Computer Programmer!

Ada Lovelace, born in 1815, is considered the world’s first computer programmer. 
She worked with Charles Babbage on his design for the Analytical Engine, an early mechanical computer.
 Lovelace recognized that the machine could do more than just calculations—it could follow a sequence of instructions, or an algorithm. 
 She wrote the first-ever computer program, making her a pioneer in computing. Her visionary ideas laid the foundation for modern programming languages. 
 Today, the programming language "Ada" is named in her honor. Despite living in the 19th century, her work predicted the future of computers. 
 She is celebrated every year on Ada Lovelace Day for her contributions to technology.
